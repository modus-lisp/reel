;;;; vp8-parse.lisp — a VP8 keyframe PARSER, built on the bit-exact bool decoder.
;;;;
;;;; This is a debugging oracle, not a decoder: it reads a keyframe's headers and token partition
;;;; and reports what it finds.  Pointed at a libvpx-produced frame it tells us whether our
;;;; understanding of the bitstream matches a real encoder's; pointed at our own frame it shows
;;;; what a reader actually sees.  Ground truth beats guessing — every VP8 fix so far came from it.
;;;;
;;;; What it has established:
;;;;   * it parses a real libvpx keyframe cleanly (headers, quantizer, modes, coefficients), so our
;;;;     structural model of the bitstream is right
;;;;   * it reads OUR frames back with the values we intended
;;;;
;;;; CAUTION, learned the hard way: a parser that shares a misunderstanding with the writer will
;;;; happily agree with it.  That is what happened with skip_eob_node (see READ-TOKEN) — writer and
;;;; parser agreed, and only ffmpeg disagreed.  When the two agree but a real decoder does not,
;;;; suspect this file as much as the encoder.
