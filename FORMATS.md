# What plays, what does not, and what it would take

This is the road map for the media stack: [reel](.) decodes pictures, [cassette](../cassette)
holds the containers they arrive in, [reed](../reed) does audio. It exists because "can it play
this file?" is the only question anyone actually asks, and the answer lives in three repositories.

Proportions below are from experience, not from measuring a corpus. Treat them as ordering, not
as data.

## Plays today

| | verified against |
|---|---|
| **VP8**, key and inter frames | libvpx, bit-exact on eight clips and on Big Buck Bunny |
| **H.264 Baseline, Main and High** | ffmpeg, bit-exact on twenty-two fixtures, on a 7672-frame YouTube file and on 300 frames of 640x360 High profile, every frame |
| **MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video** | ffmpeg, bit-exact on thirteen fixtures, every frame |
| **MPEG-4 Part 2** (DivX, XviD) | ffmpeg, bit-exact on eleven fixtures, every frame |
| **WebM and Matroska** | they are the same demuxer; `.mkv` with H.264 decodes today |
| **MP4**, including fragmented | ffprobe, packet for packet |
| **MPEG program and transport streams** | `.mpg`, `.vob`, `.ts` open and play, end to end |
| **AVI**, including OpenDML | `.avi` opens and plays, whatever codec is inside |
| **Opus, AAC, MP3, MPEG audio Layer II, Vorbis** | reed's own suites; Layer II within 0.0002 RMS of ffmpeg |

H.264 covers CAVLC and CABAC, P and B slices, both direct modes, weighted and implicit weighted
prediction, reference list reordering, adaptive reference marking, the 8x8 transform, Intra_8x8,
scaling matrices, and the in-loop filter. About 118 fps at 640x360 and 71 at 1080p, decoding
independent pictures concurrently.

That set is what x264 produces with no options at all, which is the point: High is x264's default
profile, so most H.264 encoded since about 2010 is High rather than Main.

MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 are one decoder, because they are one bitstream: an MPEG-2 sequence header is byte
for byte an MPEG-1 one and everything MPEG-2 added arrives afterwards in extensions. It covers I, P
and B pictures, both scan orders, both quantiser ladders, custom weight matrices, and interlaced
coding — field DCT and field motion inside a frame picture, which is what DVDs are.

Its inverse transform is the one place in the stack where bit-exactness is not a meaningful goal:
MPEG-2 requires only the accuracy of IEEE 1180, so two conforming decoders may legitimately differ
by one in a sample. This one matches ffmpeg's `simple` transform exactly, which is what lets the
comparison mean something; `src/mpeg2/idct.lisp` says which three parts of its arithmetic are not
what the mathematics alone would suggest.

MPEG-4 Part 2 covers Simple and Advanced Simple: one and four motion vectors, both quantisers, B
pictures with direct mode, video packets, and quarter-sample motion. That is what DivX and XviD
produce.

## Refused, and refused loudly

Anything below is turned away with a reason rather than decoded wrong. That distinction is the
whole discipline of this decoder: a wrong picture that keeps playing is worse than no picture,
because nobody knows to disbelieve it.

- H.264: more than 8 bits per sample, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4, MBAFF and field coding, FMO, long-term
  references, and `memory_management_control_operation` 5. Each is refused on the FLAG that turns it
  on rather than on the profile that permits it, so a High profile stream using none of them decodes
  here.
- MPEG-2: field pictures, dual-prime motion vectors, and anything but 4:2:0.
- MPEG-4 Part 2: sprites and global motion, interlaced objects, data partitioning, scalability, and
  arbitrary shapes. Also Microsoft's pre-standard MPEG-4 variants (DIV3, MP42), which share a name
  and not a bitstream.
- AC-3 and DTS, which a DVD may carry instead of MPEG audio. A file's video plays and the audio
  track is named as undecodable rather than guessed at.

## The gaps, in the order I would close them

### 1. FFV1 in Matroska

The one people forget. FFV1 is the actual **preservation** codec — lossless, and what national
libraries and film archives keep masters in. The container is already supported, so this is codec
work only, and it is a range-coded lossless codec rather than a transform codec, so almost nothing
in reel is reusable. Worth it for the archival case, not the consumption case.

### 2. Theora in Ogg

The Archive's own older open-format derivatives. A VP3 descendant, so genuinely close to the VP8
code already here.

### 3. VP9

The other half of what the web actually serves. Big, but the better target than HEVC if the goal is
playing what people link you.

## Not worth it, and why

- **HEVC / H.265.** Larger than all of H.264 put together: coding tree units with quadtrees, 35
  intra directions, a different CABAC context set, transform unit trees, sample adaptive offset. If
  another modern codec is wanted, VP9 costs less and appears more often.
- **Flash-era video** (Sorenson Spark, VP6 in FLV), **RealVideo**, **Windows Media and VC-1**,
  **MJPEG**. Real content exists in all of them, but each is a separate codec for a shrinking
  audience. Curiosities rather than plans.
- **Microsoft's pre-standard MPEG-4** (DIV3, MP42, MPG4). Named like MPEG-4 Part 2 and not the same
  bitstream. A separate decoder for a format that existed for about three years.

## Small things that are nearly free

- **H.264 decode speed at 1080p.** 71 fps concurrently, but single-threaded it is 10.6, and the
  deblocking filter is a third of that. Matters for a single-core or latency-bound path.
