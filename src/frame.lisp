;;;; vp8.lisp — VP8 keyframe encoder (RFC 6386 §9,§19.2).
;;;;
;;;; Assembles a decodable VP8 keyframe: the 10-byte uncompressed chunk (frame tag + start code +
;;;; dimensions), the bool-coded first partition (frame header + per-macroblock modes), and the
;;;; DCT-token partition.  Built up + validated against ffmpeg's libvpx decoder one layer at a time.
;;;;
;;;; STATUS: uncompressed header done + byte-verified vs a real ffmpeg keyframe.  The bool-coded
;;;; first partition (token-prob updates, quantizer, per-MB intra modes) and the token partition
;;;; are next — they need VP8's large constant probability tables (RFC 6386 §13).
