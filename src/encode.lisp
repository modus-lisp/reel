;;;; vp8-encode.lisp — a real VP8 keyframe encoder: DC+AC coefficients, correct entropy
;;;; contexts, and prediction-aware residuals.
;;;;
;;;; The three things the earlier bring-up got wrong, fixed here:
;;;;
;;;;  1. PREDICTION.  A macroblock is not coded against 128 — it is coded against its DC_PRED
;;;;     prediction, the average of the RECONSTRUCTED pixels above and to the left.  So we keep
;;;;     reconstruction planes and encode residual = source - prediction, macroblock by macroblock
;;;;     in raster order, reconstructing as we go (exactly what the decoder will do).
;;;;
;;;;  2. ENTROPY CONTEXT.  Coefficient probabilities are selected by a context: for the FIRST
;;;;     coded coefficient it is (left-block-had-nonzero + above-block-had-nonzero); after that it
;;;;     is 0/1/2 from the previous coefficient's magnitude.  We keep per-plane left/above flags.
;;;;
;;;;  3. FULL COEFFICIENTS.  All 16 coefficients per block in zigzag order, with the band table
;;;;     selecting probabilities, and EOB once the rest are zero.
;;;;
;;;; Luma uses 16x16 DC_PRED, so the sixteen 4x4 luma DCs go through the WHT into the Y2 block and
;;;; the luma blocks themselves are coded from coefficient 1.
;;;;
;;;; STATUS: correct.  ENCODE-GRAY-FRAME's second return value is the encoder's own reconstruction,
;;;; and it is bit-identical to what ffmpeg's decoder produces for every image, size and quantizer
;;;; index tested (flat, gradients, hard edges, uniform noise; 0..127; non-multiple-of-16 sizes).
;;;;
;;;; Two bugs were fixed to get here, both about matching the reference exactly:
;;;;
;;;;  a. SKIP_EOB_NODE.  The EOB branch of the coefficient tree is NOT coded after a ZERO
;;;;     coefficient — libvpx's GetCoeffs (decoder/detokenize.c) re-enters the tree below node 0
;;;;     in that case, and its tokenizer mirrors it with `t->skip_eob_node = (pt == 0)`.  Emitting
;;;;     that bit desynchronised the whole token partition as soon as any block had an interior
;;;;     zero, i.e. as soon as the picture had detail.  See WRITE-BLOCK.
;;;;
;;;;  b. The Y2 AC quantizer is libvpx's exact integer form (ac_q * 101581) >> 16 with a floor of
;;;;     8, not ac_q * 155/100 rounded to nearest; the two disagree at 63 of the 128 quantizer
;;;;     indices.  See Y2-AC-QUANT in vp8-dct.lisp.
;;;;
;;;; And one thing that turned out NOT to be a bug: a supposed 1.2x amplitude error (once papered
;;;; over by a `+y2-dc-fudge+' constant) was an artefact of the measurement, not the codec.
;;;; Decoding with `ffmpeg -pix_fmt gray' makes swscale expand limited-range luma to full range
;;;; (x255/219 = 1.164); decode to yuv420p and take the Y plane to see what VP8 actually produced.
