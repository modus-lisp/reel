;;;; vp8-bool.lisp — VP8's boolean entropy coder (RFC 6386 §7 decoder, §13.2 encoder).
;;;;
;;;; A binary range coder: every syntax element in a VP8 frame is coded as a series of bool
;;;; decisions, each with an 8-bit probability (of the bit being 0).  This is THE primitive the
;;;; whole codec is built on, so it has to be bit-exact — hence a round-trip test against our own
;;;; decoder.  Ported from the libvpx reference (boolhuff.c / dboolhuff), with the low/value
;;;; registers kept explicitly masked to 32/16 bits since Lisp integers don't wrap.

(in-package #:reel)

;;; ---- encoder ---------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; EVERY SLOT IS TYPED, and the buffer is a SIMPLE array with an explicit fill index rather than
;;; an adjustable vector with a fill pointer.  Both are about the same thing: this is the codec's
;;; innermost loop — a 1280x800 keyframe runs it 687k times — and untyped slots made every one of
;;; those iterations do generic arithmetic on boxed values (the profile showed GENERIC-+, GENERIC-*
;;; and a full call to ASH inside it), while the adjustable buffer made the byte store a full call
;;; to VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND and the carry loop's AREF a HAIRY-DATA-VECTOR-REF.  The types below are
;;; the ones the algorithm actually guarantees:
;;;
;;;   RANGE  is 255 to start and thereafter (ASH range (- 8 (INTEGER-LENGTH range))), which for any
;;;          range in 1..255 lands in 128..255 — so (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) is exact, not a guess.
;;;   LOW    is masked to 32 bits on every path that writes it.
;;;   OFFSET is -COUNT-before-the-shift, and the branch is only reached when COUNT+SHIFT >= 0 with
;;;          SHIFT <= 8, so COUNT-before is at least -8.  Saying so is what turns (ASH low ...) from
;;;          a full call into a shift instruction: without a sign for the shift count the compiler
;;;          cannot pick a direction.
