;;;; vp8-inter.lisp — inter (P) frames: the thing that makes a desktop stream cheap.
;;;;
;;;; A keyframe costs ~76 KB and ~300 ms for a 1280x800 screen, so keyframe-only streaming runs at
;;;; well under 1 fps.  But a desktop is mostly static: with an inter frame every macroblock that
;;;; has not changed is a single skip bit against the previous frame, and only the parts that
;;;; actually moved carry coefficients.
;;;;
;;;; TWO inter modes matter here, and a macroblock picks between them:
;;;;
;;;;   * ZEROMV against LAST_FRAME — the prediction is the co-located pixels of the previous
;;;;     reconstruction.  Free, and right for everything that appears, disappears or redraws in
;;;;     place, which is most of what a desktop does.
;;;;
;;;;   * a GLOBAL MOTION VECTOR — the prediction is the previous reconstruction shifted by one
;;;;     (dx,dy) shared by the whole frame.  A scroll or a window drag translates a large region
;;;;     by exactly one vector, and against ZEROMV alone that costs a full re-encode of every
;;;;     macroblock it touches: the rate control then rations it out over seconds of mush.  With
;;;;     the vector, the translated part is a skip bit and a mode, and only the newly exposed
;;;;     strip carries coefficients.
;;;;
;;;; The restriction that makes this cheap is INTEGER-PEL vectors.  Luma prediction is then a
;;;; plain block copy — no six-tap filter.  Chroma is not quite free: a 4:2:0 chroma vector is the
;;;; luma vector halved, so an ODD luma vector lands on a chroma half-pel and the decoder runs its
;;;; six-tap filter there.  %SIXTAP-8X8 reproduces that exactly (libvpx vp8_sixtap_predict8x8_c);
;;;; without it the reconstruction would drift from the decoder's on every odd scroll.
;;;;
;;;; Where the vector comes from, in order of preference:
;;;;   1. told to us — :MOTION (dx . dy), the same "the screen moved by this much" fact that
;;;;      drives an RFB CopyRect (glass's FB-TAKE-COPY hint);
;;;;   2. estimated — %ESTIMATE-GLOBAL-MV, a vote over a dozen high-detail probe macroblocks.
;;;;      Exhaustive along one axis (a scroll is exactly that) and a coarse 2-D grid otherwise.
;;;; A wrong estimate costs a little time and nothing else: every macroblock still compares the
;;;; two predictions and keeps the better one, so the newly exposed strip and any non-translating
;;;; content code as ZEROMV regardless.
;;;;
;;;; Both are gated: *MOTION-VECTORS* off restores the pure-ZEROMV encoder exactly, and
;;;; *MOTION-SEARCH* off keeps the vector but takes it only from a caller's hint.
;;;;
;;;; Entropy coding follows libvpx: vp8_mv_ref_tree with probabilities from vp8_mode_contexts
;;;; indexed by the neighbour counts of vp8_find_near_mvs (%FIND-NEAR-MVS reproduces it,
;;;; including the clamps), NEARESTMV/NEARMV when a neighbour already carries the vector, and
;;;; NEWMV — a delta against the neighbourhood's best MV — otherwise.  Vectors are chosen so the
;;;; decoder's own MV clamp never fires and the prediction never reads outside the reference.

it.  The fallback for a drag, which moves on both axes at once so nothing separable finds it — and
on detailed content a coarse grid alone lands BESIDE the answer, which is no use when the point is
an exact translation.  Distinct winners, most-named first.

TWO SCALES, because a drag has two.  The coarse comparison DECIMATES rather than blurs, so on text
a grid point two pixels off the answer scores no better than one nowhere near it: the grid can
only find what it lands on exactly, or near enough for the refinement to walk in.  A step of four
is close enough over most of the range, but it misses displacements that are small AND odd — a
window nudged twenty across and ten down — which is the commonest interactive case of all.  So the
first +-NEAR pixels are swept every NEAR-STEP, and the rest every STEP.  Each scale nominates its
own candidates, so a crowd of near ones cannot shut the far ones out.

THE GRID IS ANCHORED ON ZERO, which is not a detail.  Stepping from -LIMIT upward puts the grid on
the residue class of LIMIT, so a limit that is not a multiple of the step yields a grid containing
no multiple of the step at all — no zero, and none of the displacements a screen actually moves
by.  The search then reports whatever noise scores best, having never evaluated the answer.  This
was survivable only because the range used to be +-96, which is a multiple of 4 by luck.

RANGE IS THE FORMAT'S, not a cost guard.  Between two frames of a drag the picture moves by
whatever the sender could not afford to encode in between: a few pixels when the link is free and
two hundred when it is not, the same gesture sampled at a different rate.  Capped at +-96, a drag
that moved further than that between two frames had no vector at all — it was priced, and coded,
as if the whole screen were new content, which is the expensive way to say a window slid sideways.

Candidates are the best few DISTINCT neighbourhoods rather than the best few points: a good match
arrives as a cluster, and a cluster around one decoy would otherwise take every slot.

Generation may be noisy; %VOTE is what decides.  A probe in the newly exposed strip names
something arbitrary, and nobody agrees with it.

The sweep keeps its shortlist in preallocated arrays rather than a list of candidates: at a step of
four over the format's range it visits ~16000 displacements per probe, and consing one cell per
displacement costs several times what the comparisons do."

;;; ---- what a frame will cost, before it is coded ----------------------------
;;;
;;; A sender that has to choose between an inter frame and a keyframe needs a price for each, and
;;; the price of an inter frame is not one number times a macroblock count.  There are TWO
;;; populations in a changed region and they cost different things:
;;;
;;;   translating  — the pixels are the previous frame's, displaced by the frame's vector.  The
;;;                  macroblock codes a mode and a vector reference and NO coefficients: about a
;;;                  byte, and the same byte at every quantizer.
;;;   new          — genuinely different content.  Coefficients, priced by the learned
;;;                  bytes-per-macroblock figure and moving with the quantizer.
;;;
;;; A drag or a scroll is almost entirely the first kind while looking, to anything that only
;;; counts dirty macroblocks, exactly like the second.  That is why the caller is given the count
;;; and not just the vector: "most of the screen changed" and "most of the screen moved" have to
;;; be different numbers or a translation gets priced as a re-encode.

reproduce exactly.  What is approximate is
the CENSUS — every SAMPLE-th changed macroblock is tested and the count scaled — because the
answer only has to be good enough to choose between two frame types, and testing all of them would
cost as much as the encode it is meant to inform.

  "Encode one inter frame of Y/U/V against the encoder's reference, updating the reference in
place.  Unchanged macroblocks are skipped outright.  DIRTY, when given, is a per-macroblock bit
vector of what the capture reported as updated — macroblocks it clears are skipped without
touching a pixel, which is far cheaper than rediscovering that by comparison.

MOTION is how far the picture MOVED since the last frame, in whole pixels, as (dx . dy) — the
CopyRect fact.  NIL means work it out (see *MOTION-SEARCH*), :NONE means there is none.  Every
macroblock then chooses between that vector and ZEROMV by which predicts it better, so a scroll
codes as a mode bit per translated macroblock plus coefficients for the strip that is new.

FORCE codes every macroblock DIRTY selects even if its pixels are unchanged: that is the idle
refinement pass, which re-codes at a low qi whatever was last coded coarsely (the residual against
the existing reference sharpens the decoder's copy).  Macroblocks coded above CLEAN-QI are
recorded in the encoder's stale set; those at or below it are cleared.

MAX-MBS bounds how many macroblocks this frame may code.  Beyond it, macroblocks that wanted
coding are left skipped and reported in the returned DEFERRED bit vector so the caller can carry
them into the next frame.  That bounds FRAME SIZE, which is what actually bounds latency: one
143 KB frame is ~570 ms in flight on a 250 KB/s link, and no average-rate control can see that.
A big change then arrives as a couple of progressive frames instead of one long stall.

MAX-BYTES bounds the same thing DIRECTLY, and it is the only one of the two that can promise
anything.  A macroblock count is a byte count only through a per-macroblock AVERAGE, and the
average is not what a slice of a desktop costs: a band of body text is several times a band of
window chrome, so a caller that sizes its slice from the mean overruns whenever the slice lands on
the dense part.  Measured on the refinement pass at 160 kbps, sizing by MAX-MBS alone against a
3384 byte budget: 9518 bytes, 2.8x over.  With this the frame simply stops — the macroblocks it
had not reached defer exactly as they do under MAX-MBS, so nothing new can happen to them.  The
bound is approached from below and overshot by at most one macroblock's tokens plus the skip flags
of the ones after it, which are unavoidable in any case.

ALLOW, when given, is a per-macroblock bit vector saying which macroblocks this frame may spend
RESIDUAL bytes on.  A macroblock it clears defers exactly as one past MAX-BYTES does — it is not
coded, it is marked stale (and unsent, on a live frame) and it comes back in DEFERRED.  It is the
same gate as the two bounds above, moved from \"whatever the raster scan reached first\" to
\"whatever the caller ranked first\", and that is its whole reason for existing: a bound that cuts
in scan order spends the budget on the top of the screen, which is a place, not a priority.

IT DOES NOT GATE TRANSLATION, and must not.  A macroblock the frame's vector carries outright is
already free — a mode bit and a vector reference, no coefficients — so it is settled above this
test and rides the vector whether ALLOW selects it or not.  Rationing those would price a drag as
new content, which is the thing the vector exists to avoid; what is rationed here is the genuinely
new content, which is the only part a quantizer or a budget can trade against.

Returns (values bytes coded-mb-count deferred motion-vector quantizer translated).  QUANTIZER is
the one the frame was ACTUALLY coded at, which is not always QI — see the backlog rule above.  A
caller that models what a quantizer costs has to be told which one it got, or its next estimate is
wrong by whatever the encoder decided on its own.  TRANSLATED is how many macroblocks the vector
carried outright, coefficient-free: the same census PREDICT-MOTION estimates, but exact, so a
caller learning what a translation costs learns it from the count that actually happened."
